..:: AN NGINX WORKSHOP - BLUEPRINT IN AWS ::..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION

This workshop has been developed to assist SEs in building a workshop around NGINX and its multiple features:

* WEB Server (conteinerized)
* NGINX Unit (conteinerized)
* NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller
* NGINX Plus (LB / Reverse Proxy)
* NGINX Controller 3.x
* NGINX API Gateway
* Augmented use case with NGINX KIC and BIG-IP CIS in Calico mode and / or NodePort.

For anything related to this blueprint, please get in touch with Paolo Arcagni, p.arcagni@f5.com

WHAT'S AVAILABLE?

* 3 x Networks (Management, external, internal)
* 1 x Windows Server Jumhost, with Chrome and Postman installed
* 1 x BIG-IP called bigip-security (15.0.1)
* 2 x NGINX Plus running on Ubuntu Server 18.04
* 1 x NGINX Controller running on Ubuntu Server 18.04
* 1 x k8s CLuster (1 master and 2 nodes, everything built on Ubuntu Server 18.04)
* 1 x "infra-server", an Ubuntu Server 18.04 Host which is acting as the main control point of the entire Blueprint.

Docker is running on infra-server and providing the following functions:

* Gitlab 
* Rancher GUI
* Private Docker Registry
* Grafana
* Prometheus
* Grafite / Statsd

All UI for these dockers are available through BIG-IP VS published in the BIG-IP component on this Blueprint. 

Credentials are logged in the dedicated panel inside each blueprint component. 
All Ubuntu boxes are accessible through SSH from the blueprint using SSH keys and "ubuntu" user.
Gitlab and Grafana are all fresh install and will ask for a password definition at first login. 

K8s was configure from the Ansible Playbook to run the CALICO overlay network; BIG-IP was added as a BGP Peer. BGP Configuration for Calico on BIG-IP has been done.

k8s cluster was imported in RancherUI as k8s-udf (look in infra-server description for Rancher credentials)

BUILDING THE BLUEPRINT

A document with a complete set of instractions on how to build this blueprint through Ansible playbooks is available at this address: https://github.com/tomminux/nginx-workshop-udf-blueprint/blob/master/README.md

The Github repository https://github.com/tomminux/nginx-workshop-udf-blueprint contains all the playbooks and files needed to build this blueprint.
